# GuessMovieGame
## Description
This is an Java project that represent a guessing game where the player has to guess the movie name given the number
of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies)!
## What I learned
* Used Math Java methods to choose a random movie name
* Used File Java library to retrive the movie list file.
* Used Scanner Java.util to read the movie list
